# Register your flood risk activity exemptions

To quote the main guidance page.

> You may need an environmental permit if you want to work in, over, under or near a main river or flood or sea defence.
>
> Some flood risk activities are exempt from needing a permit and you can carry out the work if you register an exemption.
